# Day 3: Learn Linux and Bash

## Summary
- Today, I learned and practice I/O redirection in Linux, I also learnt using commands like `cat`, `sort`, `uniq`, `head`, `tail`, `tee`, and `grep` etc.
- Explored stdin, stdout and stderr, manipulated the output of commands from stdout to a file using `>` and `>>` redirection operator, learnt about file descriptors, `2>` which is a cmd to redirect stderr. Further learnt about a special file called `/dev/null` and also learnt about pipelines and how we can chain the output of a command to the input of another command.
