# Day 1: Learn Linux and Bash (cont'd)

## Summary
This week-two is supposed to be for Version Control and Markdown (This is where i start with the LTC guide) However, i was not able to cover a tangible amount of Linux concepts in week-one so my Linux and Bash learning now extends to week-two. Hopefully, i get to pace up and wrap up Linux and Bash this week 💪🏿

- Today, I learnt about `su` and `sudo`, explored `chown` command which is used for changing file owner and group. I also learnt about `chgrp` command which is used for changing group ownership. 

## Struggles
- Understanding the key differences between `su` and `sudo` commands.

## Resources Used
- [Learn to Cloud Guide](https://learntocloud.guide/)
- *The Linux Command Line* by William Shotts (Chapter 9)

## Next Steps
- Move to chapter 10 of TLCL book - Permissions
