# Day 2: Learn Linux and Bash (cont'd)

## Summary
Today, I learned about how processes works in Linux, how to view processes using `ps` command. I also learnt about the various process states (R-Running, S-Sleeping, Z-Zombie etc) I also learnt other about the options applicable to the `ps` commands such as "aux" to display more info about process, using `top` command.

## Struggles
None for today.
